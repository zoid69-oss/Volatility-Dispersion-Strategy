### Volatility Dispersion Strategy  
#### Exploiting Volatility Discrepancies in BankNifty and Its Constituents  

**Project Overview**  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and supporting Python scripts that explore a volatility dispersion strategy applied to the BankNifty index and its constituent stocks. The strategy aims to identify and capitalize on mismatches in implied volatilities between the index and its components, presenting profitable trading opportunities.

**Key Features**  

1. **Implied Volatility Computation**  
   - Demonstrates how to calculate implied volatilities for both the BankNifty index and its constituent stocks using the `mibian` library.  

2. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Provides a methodology to compute and analyze dirty implied correlations, revealing volatility relationships between the index and its components.  

3. **Signal Identification**  
   - Includes a logic-driven approach to generate trading signals based on deviations from average correlations, enabling precise trade execution.  

4. **Strategy Performance Evaluation**  
   - Uses historical data to assess the profitability and risk profile of the dispersion strategy, highlighting potential returns.  

5. **Interactive Parameter Testing**  
   - Allows users to experiment with different parameters in an interactive environment to visualize their impact on the strategy's outcomes.  

This project offers a robust framework for understanding and implementing a volatility-based dispersion trading approach.
